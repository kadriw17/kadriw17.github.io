<p class="head1"> <i>The high school tech club</i> </p>
   During my final year of high school, I was attacked by two classmates, Cameron Abbot and Marquis Lewis, to join tech club. I had found the idea of learning programing interesting and wanted to try it out. So far it has been fun yet the two believe it a total failure. They think they are wasting people's time but in reality the people who attend want to learn and create just as much. it just happens to be hard to find the people who are in search themselves.
