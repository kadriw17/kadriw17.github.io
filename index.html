<p class="head1">The high school tech club</p>
   During my final year of high school, I was attacked by two classmates, Cameron Abbot and Marquis Lewis, to join tech club. I had found the idea of learning programing interesting and wanted to try it out. So far it has been fun yet the two believe it a total failure. They think they are wasting people's time but in reality the people who attend want to learn and create just as much. it just happens to be hard to find the people who are in search themselves.
   
    
    <p class="h2"> About Me </p>
    As I grow older, I become one with my identity as well. From a black female who has the goal of being a Mechanical Engineer to added beliefs of gender equality, LGBT, and environmentalism. This identity has served as a blessing and a curse in my generation, considering the world is forever adjusting to the change of original social norms and Iâ€™m part of the minority that, in my opinion, has to work extremely hard to have titles like Mechanical Engineer or Innovator. My struggle is to constantly be reminded of my color and having to hear what people think I should be or to question my abilities. I took it upon myself to create a foundation from my blessings, which is my surroundings of talented people who I am honored to call my friends and family.
